# Basic node app with most required modules/packages
This is a basic node app. You can download it and start your new project easily. I have added few necessary modules in it.

You can update or uninstall the packages by following the below commands.

npm install --save express
```

npm update --save express

npm uninstall --save express

```

###### Update async and save it in your packages

## grunt
I have installed grunt as dev package because when we deploy package on a server we donâ€™t want our development packages published on the server.

###### Install grunt and save it in your packages
```
npm install --save-dev grunt
```

###### Update grunt and save it in your packages
```
npm update --save-dev grunt
```
###### Uninstall grunt and remove from packages
```
npm uninstall --save-dev grunt
```

#### How to test app.

Just clone the repository and go the the folder on your command line and run following command. After that you can open demo page on your localhost on port 3000. You can change the port in app.js

```
node app.js
```
